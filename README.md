# Jazzinghen's AOC implementations - Rust

[![Rust](https://github.com/Jazzinghen/AdventOfCode/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Jazzinghen/AdventOfCode/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

I am doing this in my free time whenever I have the energies. Rust hates me.

## 2021

I finished it! It was an uphill battle, but towards the end it became easier and
easier.

Also, you might want to build everything with `cargo build -r` to check the
actual speed of the solutions. As an example solution to day 23 went from
`6s 393ms 612µs` and `9s 564ms 869µs` in debug mode to `593ms 817µs` and
`678ms 579µs` in release mode.

## Advent of Code Rust Template

Advent of Code Rust template from [Replit's AoC templates][1], with some changes
to make the process smoother (and probably even make Clippy happy).
